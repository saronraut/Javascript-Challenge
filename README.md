# Javascript-Challenge


The JavaScript challenge was to display our knowledge in JS and DOM Manipulation. In the html page, we had to display the table of UFO sighting and create a filter button which allows you to filter table by date of sighting.

 /Instruction/ Folder contains all the code that was worked on for this assignment. 

 /Instruction/UFO-level-{}/static/ contains multiple folders within: 
    
    - css : was already provided in the folder. No modification or coding required

    - images : was already provided in the folder. No modification or coding required

    - js : app.js is where all the coding was accomplished for the assignment. data.js contained the JSON format of the table.


UFO-level-1 : Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

    - wrote a code that appends a table to your web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting. 

    - Used date form in HTML doc to write JS code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input. 

UFO-level-2 : Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

    - Using the same codes(copy) of level 1, built more functionality for filtering. 

    - Using multiple input tags, wrote a code that allows users to set mutliple filters for UFO sighting using the displayed criteria in the table. 

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
